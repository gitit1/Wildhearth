# WORKLOG — Wildhearth

Purpose: a running, detailed record of every unit of work done on the game.
This is **not a roadmap and not an index** — it is the "what actually
happened" log. One block per completed task, newest at the top. Bring this
file to the design chat and it alone should tell you the exact state of the
project.

## How to write an entry (the agent MUST follow this)

- **One block = one task = one commit.** Never merge two tasks into one
  entry, and never split one task across two.
- Write the entry **after** the work is done and `npm run build` passes, and
  **before** the commit — updating this file is part of the commit (see
  `CLAUDE.md`).
- **Be specific.** Name every file created or changed, every system /
  function / data structure / save key added or touched, and the actual
  player-facing behavior that changed.
  - ✗ "Added fishing polish."
  - ✓ "Added quality tiers to catch resolution in `src/systems/fishing.ts`
    via `resolveCatch()`; new `Quality` enum + `rollQuality()`; sell price
    now multiplied by quality in `src/systems/economy.ts`."
- If anything was left unfinished, or a decision is still open, put it under
  **Follow-ups** so it is never lost. Do not silently drop it.

## Step 8 — Farm repair (tier-1 visible renovation)
- **Date:** 2026-07-04
- **Block given:** (from `docs/ROADMAP_MVP.md`, Step 8 — Farm repair
  (visible renovation, tier 1 only))
  - `src/art/buildings.ts`: add a "rundown" paint variant for the house
    (patched roof hole, boarded window, broken-plank fence) alongside the
    existing normal state.
  - `src/systems/renovation.ts`: 3–4 fixed repair actions (fix fence, patch
    roof, fix door), each costs coins + requires being near the farmhouse,
    flips one rundown flag to fixed and swaps the painter output.
  - Checkpoint: the farm visibly changes as a direct result of money earned
    — the renovation arc from VISION.md is now real, not just described.
- **Done:**
  - **Files:**
    - `src/systems/renovation.ts` (NEW): the farm-repair state module — four
      per-part flags, load/save/reset, persisted on its own versioned key.
    - `src/config.ts`: added `REPAIR_COST = { roof: 25, window: 15, barn: 30,
      fence: 10 }` (tuning for the four repairs) and `RENOVATION_KEY =
      "wildhearth-farm-v1"` (the new save key).
    - `src/art/buildings.ts`: `drawHouse` signature changed from a single
      `rundown` bool to per-part `(g, roofOk = true, windowOk = true)` — the
      roof-hole-and-patch is gated by `!roofOk`, the boarded window by
      `!windowOk`, so each defect can clear independently. `drawBarn` changed
      to `(g, barnOk = true)` (missing plank + loose door board gated by
      `!barnOk`).
    - `src/art/props.ts`: `drawFence` changed to `(g, fenceOk = true)` with an
      internal `const rundown = !fenceOk` (broken-plank gap + leaning posts
      now clear when the field fence is mended).
    - `src/systems/interact.ts`: added the farmhouse as a clickable
      renovation hub — `REPAIRS` table, `doRepair()`, the `house`
      `Interactable`, and `farm` on `InteractCtx`; imports `saveEconomy`,
      `saveFarm`, `REPAIR_COST`, and `HOUSE`.
    - `src/main.ts`: loads the farm state (`const farm = loadFarm()`), passes
      `farm` into the interaction context, resets it on New Game
      (`resetFarm(farm)`), and drives the three painters from the flags
      (`drawFence(ctx, farm.fence)`, `drawHouse(ctx, farm.roof, farm.window)`,
      `drawBarn(ctx, farm.barn)`); the old blanket `FARM_RUNDOWN` const is
      removed.
    - `docs/ROADMAP_MVP.md`: Step 8 marked (DONE) with the dated completion
      note (carried over from the build session).
  - **Systems / functions:**
    - New save key `wildhearth-farm-v1` (`RENOVATION_KEY`).
    - New type `FarmState { version, roof, window, barn, fence }` and the
      `FarmPart = "roof" | "window" | "barn" | "fence"` union.
    - New functions in `renovation.ts`: `loadFarm()`, `saveFarm()`,
      `resetFarm()` (New Game → all broken), `repairsLeft()`.
    - `interact.ts`: `doRepair(c, part)` — checks coins against
      `REPAIR_COST[part]`, deducts + `saveEconomy`, flips the flag +
      `saveFarm`, toasts the result; new `farm: FarmState` field on
      `InteractCtx`; the `house` interactable's `actions()` lists only the
      still-broken repairs (priority roof → window → barn → fence) plus Look.
    - Painter signatures changed to read per-part flags (see Files).
  - **Behavior:** The farm starts fully rundown (roof hole + patch, boarded
    window, missing barn plank + crooked door board, broken-plank fence +
    leaning posts). Walking up to the farmhouse offers a paid repair for each
    still-broken part — left-click / E does the next one, right-click lists
    them all (Patch the roof 25 / Reglaze the window 15 / Mend the barn 30 /
    Mend the fence 10). Each repair deducts coins, flips its flag, and swaps
    the art on that structure instantly. Too few coins → a "Not enough coins
    — that repair costs N." refusal with no flag change. Once every part is
    mended the house only offers Look. Repairs (and the spent coins) persist
    across reload; New Game wipes the farm back to fully rundown.
- **Build:** `npm run build` — ✅ passing.
- **Verification:** headless Playwright drove the real game (11/11 checks):
  rundown start, all four repairs with correct coin deductions (200 → 120)
  and live visual swaps, the broke-player refusal, Look-only once whole, and
  persistence across reload; New Game reset to rundown.
- **Commit:** <fill after committing>
- **Follow-ups:** The Building/Renovation *skill* is not yet wired to these
  repair actions — repairing currently trains no skill and applies no
  skill-based discount. Deferred to the "Complete the base skill set" block
  in `docs/ROADMAP_EXPANSION.md`.
